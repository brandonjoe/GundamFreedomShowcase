# Mobile Suit Showcase

This site was made to practice my eye for design. The contents of this website relate to a mobile suit plastic model kit from an animated series called "Gundam." While I do enjoy making custom model kits (haven't had the time recently because of web development), my works are nowhere near as clean as the modeler who made this kit. This work is the top .5% of work of the 1000s of different kit I've seen. Because of the clean look this custom model has, I've decided to dedicate a mock website for it. There is a sense of elegance to well-crafted model kits like these, and I hope this website reflects it.

### General Use

There isn't much to using this website. It's responsive and the gallery has a lightbox.

### Future Plans

I don't have any future plans for this current site, but hopefully down the road, I can use images from other professional model makers to continue to make more pages but with different themes. This one had a hexagon-ish theme with the use of white and off-white colors with a hit of cool colors from the photos. If my knowledge of design and creativity expands, I plan to make more.

### Takeaway

While making previous websites, I've quickly come to realize how hard design is, but making a site with the sole purpose of "design" stresses even more how difficult it is. It's relieving that the job of a front-end developer doesn't always include design, and that there's potentially a whole team who are experts in graphic design; people who have an eye for stuff like this. I've also learned from this experience how important photography is when thinking about design. I didn't photograph any of the images seen on this website, so I had to do make do with what was presented. That being said, I'm grateful for how nice these photos are taken. There were more photos taken, especially progression photos, but I can't showcase them all without retaining the simplicity of this site and model kit.
